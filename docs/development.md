# Development Steps

1. Built CLI with Screenpipe (`/search`) and Groq (`llama3-70b-8192`).
2. Fixed Screenpipe 404s and Groq model deprecation.
3. Planned GUI branch with Calendar/Notion integrations.
4.## Issues
- Notion `404` persists despite correct ID and 'Connections.' Added error handling to GUI.
